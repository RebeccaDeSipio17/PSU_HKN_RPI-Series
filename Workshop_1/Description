Workshop 1 was an introductory workshop to setting up the raspberry pi. 

The project was to create a magic 8 ball program. The program asks the user for a question, and generates a classic "magic 8 ball" response. 
The user can then choose to ask another question to quit the program.

My implemntation used random number generator value as the input argument to a function. 

On each iteration of the while loop, the function was called and output a response. The random number generator value corresponded to the index of 
a response array which housed a mixture of magic 8 ball responses. 

Then the program printed the output and continued until the user chose to exit the script.
